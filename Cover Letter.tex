	Dear Drs. K{\"o}hler and Lambert,
	
	I have submitted a manuscript titled “Relative importance analysis for count regression models” to the \emph{Organizational Research Methods} manuscript portal and would like to request its consideration for publication in the journal as an short methodological report article format publication.
	
	This manuscript describes an extension of relative importance analysis to count regression models such as the Poisson and negative Binomial regression models. In this work, I review the dominance analysis methodology for determining relative importance, discuss a recommended model fit metric to use for the dominance analysis of count models, and review the concept of differential exposure in count regression including its effects on estimates and how to correct for it during dominance analysis.
	
	This manuscript also includes several data analytic examples and an extensive HTML formatted markdown document that interested users can review to follow along with and emulate this method as well as to review the methodology used to create the data. This work is discussed as an extension of the work of Blevins et al. (2015) who review count data, models how to choose which model, and discuss recommended practice in estimating count regressions. 
	
	I can confirm that this manuscript is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, has not appeared, and will not appear, in any other source in whole or substantial part. Moreover, this manuscript has not been previously submitted to any other source and has no submission history before this version of the manuscript. 
	
	I look forward to receiving feedback regarding this manuscript. If you have any questions regarding this paper or would like further clarification, I encourage you to contact me using email at: jluchman@forsmarsh.com
	
	Cordially,
	
	Joseph N. Luchman
